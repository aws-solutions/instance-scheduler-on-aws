## [3.0.3] -- 2024-07-31

### Security
- Upgrade fast-xml-parser to mitigate CVE-2024-41818

- Fixed KMS encryption key being deleted when DynamoDB tables were configured to be retained on stack delete
- Fixed an error that caused ASG schedule updates to fail when more than 5 schedules were updated at once
- Fixed a possible name conflict with Operational Insights Dashboard when deploying multiple copies of Instance Scheduler to the same account

### Security

- Upgrade braces to mitigate CVE-2024-4068
- Upgrade urllib3 to mitigate CVE-2024-37891

## [3.0.0] - 2024-06-05

### Added

- Added support for scheduling of Neptune and DocumentDB clusters
- Added support for scheduling of ASG through the automatic creation of Scheduled Scaling Rules from configured schedules
- Added optional Operational Insights Dashboard to CloudWatch for monitoring and insights into solution performance
- Added support for using multiple EC2 maintenance windows with a single schedule

- Extensive refactoring to internal code to improve code quality and testability
- CloudWatch metrics feature renamed to "Per Schedule Metrics" and integrated with new Operational Insights Dashboard
- DynamoDB Deletion Protection now enabled by default on solution DynamoDB tables.
- Refactored maintenance window dynamodb table to be more cost-efficient at scale
- Updated schedule logs to include SchedulingDecision entries for all decisions made by the EC2/RDS schedulers.
- Scheduler CLI will now error when attempting to overwrite schedules managed by CloudFormation

### Removed

- Configuration settings from CloudFormation parameters no longer duplicated in DynamoDB
- Remove deprecated "overwrite" Schedule flag (distinct from still-supported "override" flag)
- Cloudwatch Metrics feature replaced with Operational Monitoring

### Fixed

- Fixed deployment error in China partition, introduced in v1.5.0
- Fixed bug where CloudFormation Schedules used UTC timezone if not specified in template (instead of stack default)
- Fixed bug that would cause the scheduling request handler lambda would hang when trying to scheduler more than 50 RDS instances in the same region
- Fixed bug that would sometimes cause the CFN schedule custom resource to error when many schedules were deployed in parallel
- Fixed bug that would cause spoke stacks to not be correctly deregistered from the hub stack when undeployed
- Fixed bug in cli describe_schedule_usage command that would incorrectly estimate the behavior of schedules using nth weekday expressions
- Fixed bug that would cause schedules using monthday ranges of the format "n-31" to fail to load in months 
  with less days then the end of the range (such as February)
- Fixed configured_in_stack property not being correctly applied to periods deployed by CloudFormation custom resource.

### Security

- Break monolith Lambda Function and permissions apart based on principle of least privilege
- Spoke stack trust permissions restricted to only specific lambda roles in the Hub account
- Allow KMS keys for scheduling encrypted EBS volumes to be specified directly on hub/spoke stacks in cloudformation
  rather needing to be added to scheduling roles manually
